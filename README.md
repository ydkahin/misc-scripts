Misc scripts used on my blog

## 1. Panel
Panel dashboard generator. This comes with a Letterboxd scraper scraper (documented [here](https://ydkahin.github.io/posts/letterboxd-scraper-i/)). The scraper script generates a CSV that the dashboard generator can use.
Requirements are minimal. Just [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) and [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/).
